External knowledge base has been popularly adopted in various applications like query expansion, intent discovery, expert finding and entity resolution. But when it comes to specific domains especially like scientific areas and politics, general knowledge base could be poor in coverage in terms of both concepts and semantic links. Therefore, how to adapt and expand the general knowledge base to the focused domain effectively is definitely worthy of studying. In this paper, we propose a mining framework to address this problem via extracting an concept network from a document archive, e.g., a bibliographic archive such as DBLP, based on an existing knowledge base, i.e., Wikipedia. Specifically, this proposed framework first fits a network model with the underlying network-based representation inferred from the intersection between the document archive and the knowledge base. After that, domain preferences of latent topics fitted from the network model are estimated and back propagated to concepts and links which are uncovered by the knowledge base, from which we can finally prune out the concept network. Via extensive experiments including quantitative analysis, human evaluation and application test, we wish to show the effectiveness of our generated new knowledge graph representation.
